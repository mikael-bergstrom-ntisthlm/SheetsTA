# SheetsTA
This is a highly opinionated set of scripts and functions for Google Sheets, aimed at simplifying the process of grading student submissions. It is primarily created for courses in programming, where students submit links to their github repositories to assignments in Google Classroom.

## Installation
* Create a google apps script project, possibly contained in a Sheets spreadsheet
* Get [clasp](https://github.com/google/clasp)
* Clasp clone app script project locally
* git-clone this project (or your own fork of it) to the same directory, overwriting as necessary
* Clasp push the scripts
* Reload document

Maybe this process will be simplified or better explained later. Don't hold your breath.
